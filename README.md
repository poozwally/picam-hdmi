A simple hdmi camera using a Raspberry Pi

Welcome to my first public repo.  I made this to be able to feed hdmi video to a Herelink control system used on drones and other types of uncrewed vehicles (rovers, boats, submarines).  The Herelink system requires hdmi cameras which can be bought commercially, but I was not happy with any of the options I could buy for my projects.  Please feel to use and collaborate.

Notes: 
1) Uses Raspbian Buster Lite OS which allows the use of legacy camera software (raspicam) to sidestep difficulties encoutnered with libcamera-apps at the time of this version
2) Lite (no desktop) version of OS required to avoid conflicts with hdmi output
3) Working SBCs:
    - Raspberry Pi Zero W
4) Working cameras:
    - Rasberry Pi Camera V2.1
    - Titri Hobby Raspberry Pi IR-Cut Camera (from Amazon: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B083Y4QP84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
5) Failing cameras (help if you can!)
    - Rasberry Pi Camera V1
